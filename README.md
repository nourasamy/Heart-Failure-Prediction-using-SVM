# Heart Failure Prediction

heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv dataset contains estimates for the death
event that happens due to heart failure determined by age, anaemia, diabetes and
high blood pressure and other measures for 299 patient.

The dataset consists of 13 columns as follow:

 age
 anaemia(has anaemia or not i.e. 1 or 0)
 
 creatinine_phosphokinase(Level of CPK enzyme in blood mcg/L)
 
 diabetes(has diabetes or not i.e. 1 or 0)
 
 ejection_fraction(percentage of blood leaving heart at each contraction)
 
 high_blood_pressure(has hypertention or not)
 
 platelets (kiloplatelets/mL)
 
 serum_creatinine(Level of serum creatinine in blood mg/dL)
 
 serum_sodium(Level of serum sodium in blood mEq/L)
 
 sex(woman or man 1 or 0)
 
 smoking(smokes or not)
 
 time(follow up period in days)
 
 DEATH_EVENT(patient died during follow up period or not)

Itâ€™s required to do the following:

1. Randomly select 30% of the dataset records and save them into heart-failureTestData.csv file

2. Design and Implement a SVM algorithm to predict heart failure from features
above

3. Use the extracted Test data records from Step 1 to test your implemented
algorithm.
